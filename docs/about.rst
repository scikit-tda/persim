Persistence Images were first introduced in `Adams et al, 2017 <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-337/16-337.pdf>`_. Much of this work, an examples contained herein are inspired by the work of `Obayashi and Hiraoka, 2017 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10082>`_. Choices of weightings and general methods are often derived from `Kusano, Fukumizu, and Yasuaki Hiraoka, 2016 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01741>`_.
