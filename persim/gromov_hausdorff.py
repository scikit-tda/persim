Implementation of the modified Gromov–Hausdorff (mGH) distance
between compact metric spaces induced by unweighted graphs. This
code complements the results from "Efficient estimation of a
Gromov–Hausdorff distance between unweighted graphs" by V. Oles et
al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09772). The mGH distance was first
defined in "Some properties of Gromov–Hausdorff distances" by F.
Mémoli (Discrete & Computational Geometry, 2012).

Author: Vladyslav Oles

===================================================================

Usage examples:

1) Estimating the mGH distance between 4-clique and single-vertex
graph from their adjacency matrices. Note that it suffices to fill
only the upper triangle of an adjacency matrix.

>>> AG = [[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
>>> AH = [[0]]
>>> lb, ub = gromov_hausdorff(AG, AH)
>>> lb, ub
(0.5, 0.5)

2) Estimating the mGH distance between cycle graphs of length 2 and
5 from their adjacency matrices. Note that the adjacency matrices
can be given in both dense and sparse SciPy formats.

>>> AI = np.array([[0, 1], [0, 0]])
>>> AJ = sps.csr_matrix(([1] * 5, ([0, 0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 2, 3, 4])), shape=(5, 5))
>>> lb, ub = gromov_hausdorff(AI, AJ)
>>> lb, ub
(0.5, 1.0)

3) Estimating all pairwise mGH distances between multiple graphs
from their adjacency matrices as an iterable.

>>> As = [AG, AH, AI, AJ]
>>> lbs, ubs = gromov_hausdorff(As)
>>> lbs
array([[0. , 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
       [0.5, 0. , 0.5, 1. ],
       [0.5, 0.5, 0. , 0.5],
       [0.5, 1. , 0.5, 0. ]])
>>> ubs
array([[0. , 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
       [0.5, 0. , 0.5, 1. ],
       [0.5, 0.5, 0. , 1. ],
       [0.5, 1. , 1. , 0. ]])

===================================================================

Notations:

|X| denotes the number of elements in set X.

X → Y denotes the set of all mappings of set X into set Y.

V(G) denotes vertex set of graph G.

mGH(X, Y) denotes the modified Gromov–Hausdorff distance between
compact metric spaces X and Y.

row_i(A) denotes the i-th row of matrix A.

PSPS^n(A) denotes the set of all permutation similarities of
all n×n principal submatrices of square matrix A.

PSPS^n_{i←j}(A) denotes the set of all permutation similarities of
all n×n principal submatrices of square matrix A whose i-th row is
comprised of the entries in row_j(A).

===================================================================

Glossary:

Distance matrix of metric space X is a |X|×|X| matrix whose
(i, j)-th entry holds the distance between i-th and j-th points of
X. By the properties of a metric, distance matrices are symmetric
and non-negative, their diagonal entries are 0 and off-diagonal
entries are positive.

Curvature is a generalization of distance matrix that allows
repetitions in the underlying points of a metric space. Curvature
of an n-tuple of points from metric space X is an n×n matrix whose
(i, j)-th entry holds the distance between the points from i-th and
j-th positions of the tuple. Since these points need not be
distinct, the off-diagonal entries of a curvature can equal 0.

n-th curvature set of metric space X is the set of all curvatures
of X that are of size n×n.

d-bounded curvature for some d > 0 is a curvature whose
off-diagonal entries are all ≥ d.

Positive-bounded curvature is a curvature whose off-diagonal
entries are all positive, i.e. the points in the underlying tuple
are distinct. Equivalently, positive-bounded curvatures are
distance matrices on the subsets of a metric space.
