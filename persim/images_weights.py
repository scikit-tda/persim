"""
Weight Functions for PersistenceImager() transformer:

A valid weight function is a Python function of the form

weight(birth, persistence, **kwargs)

defining a scalar-valued function over the birth-persistence plane, where birth and persistence are assumed to be numpy arrays of equal length. To ensure stability, functions should vanish continuously at the line persistence = 0.
