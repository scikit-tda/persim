def bottleneck(dgm1, dgm2, matching=False):
    """
    Perform the Bottleneck distance matching between persistence diagrams.
    Assumes first two columns of S and T are the coordinates of the persistence
    points, but allows for other coordinate columns (which are ignored in
    diagonal matching).

    See the `distances` notebook for an example of how to use this.

    Parameters
    -----------
    dgm1: Mx(>=2)
        array of birth/death pairs for PD 1
    dgm2: Nx(>=2)
        array of birth/death paris for PD 2
    matching: bool, default False
        if True, return matching infromation and cross-similarity matrix

    Returns
    --------

    d: float
        bottleneck distance between dgm1 and dgm2
    matching: ndarray(Mx+Nx, 3), Only returns if `matching=True`
        A list of correspondences in an optimal matching, as well as their distance, where:
        * First column is index of point in first persistence diagram, or -1 if diagonal
        * Second column is index of point in second persistence diagram, or -1 if diagonal
        * Third column is the distance of each matching
